1. Ansible retrieves all server connectivity details from inventory file
2. Assuming the playbook has 2 tasks and there 5 servers listed in the inventory.
3. It will take all the inputs we have provided to the task1 and parallely it makes ssh connection to all 5 servers.
4. Then using sftp/scp it copies the ansible module (python script) from Ansible Controller Machine to the remote servers.
