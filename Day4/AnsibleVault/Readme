Ansible Vault protect your sensitive data by encrypting the files that stores sensitive data.

The below command will let you create a credentials.yml file using ansible-vault tool, which also encrypts the file 
with the password you provided at the time of creating the credentials.yml file.

ansible-vault create crendentials.yml

You could later investigate the file content
cat credentials.yml

You could edit the contents of the encrypted file by providing the same password that you used to encrypt the data
ansible-vault edit credentials.yml 

You could optionally decrypt the file explicitly as shown below
ansible-vault decrypt credentials.yml

In case, you already have created a file that holds some sensitive data that you would like to protect with Ansible vault, then
ansible-vault encrypt credentials.yml

In case you are wondering how to access this Ansible vault protected file from a playbook, try this command
ansible-playbook vault.yml
