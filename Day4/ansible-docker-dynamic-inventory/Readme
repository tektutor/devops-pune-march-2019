Ansible Dynamic Inventories are used in the place of static Ansible inventory. The convenience of using dynamic inventory is
that you don't need to modify the static inventory every time you either deleted some containers or created some.

ansible all -m ping

The above command first checks that there is an ansible.cfg in the current directory, using ansible.cfg it then understand
it should be using dynamic_inventory.py as the inventory file to get all the connection details that we normally provide via
hosts/inventory file.

Let's say you wish to now execute the ping.yml playbook you could do so now with the below command
ansible-playbook ping.yml

Interestingly, there is no hosts or inventory over there but a smart python script that finds the currently running containers
and the does the magic of what a normal static inventory would do.
