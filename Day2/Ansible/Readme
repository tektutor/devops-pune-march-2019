Assuming the playbook has 2 tasks and 5 servers listed in the inventory.

1. Ansible retrieves all server connectivity details from the inventory file.
2. Ansible then invokes the first task in the playbook on all 5 servers in parallel.
3. Using sftp/scp, Ansibles copies the ansible module (python script) from Ansible Controller Machine to all the remote servers.
4. Remotely it then exectues the ansible module scripts.
5. Waits for responses to arive from all the remote servers.
6. Then repeat the steps 2 to 5 for all remaning tasks in the Play.
7. Gives a summary in the Ansible Controller Machine about the status of the playbook execution.

Note:-
In case, let's say the first task failed on Server named 'S2' then the subsequent tasks in the playbook will not be executed on the Server 'S2', while the execution will continue normally on other remote servers until all the tasks in the playbook are completed.

You can execute the playbook with the below command

ansible-playbook install-nginx.yml
